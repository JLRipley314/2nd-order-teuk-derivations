# Second order metric perturbation of Kerr black holes: Derivations

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook that goes through some of
the derivations of the Teukolsky equation and metric reconstruction
equations in a horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidally compactified
coordinate system for the Kerr spacetime.
	
Look under **Releases** for the latest stable version of this code.

Some of the equations in the notebook refer to S. Chandrasekhar's
book [The Mathematical Theory of Black holes](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mathematical_Theory_of_Black_Holes.html?id=LBOVcrzFfhsC).
